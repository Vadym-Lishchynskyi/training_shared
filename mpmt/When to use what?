Artem Zapporozchnko version:

Threads: api calls, I/O actions, working with files etc

We should use threading when operations are (reasonable):
1)Some kind of user input or actions where you have to wait for a long time for response:
- takes lots of time
- they are not linked between each other
2)Some parallel actions:(multiprocessing is better!)
- when lots of actions lasts for more than 1ms (otherwise it will take to long to change the task)

NOTE: Number of threads less than number of cores!!! Otherwise it is more resource consuming.


One thread better when:
1) We have linked calculations better use one thread or multiprocessing.
