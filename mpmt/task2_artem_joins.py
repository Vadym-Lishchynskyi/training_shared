"""
How do join method works...

Other threads can call a threadâ€™s join() method.
This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is called is terminated.

    Without x.join()
    
    The problem here is that we got phrase 'all done' before actually doing everything
    The result looks like that:
    
    22:40:10: Main:     before creating thread      
    22:40:10: Main:     before running thread
    22:40:10: Thread 1 starting
    22:40:10: Main:     wait for the thread to finish
    22:40:10: Main:     all done                        'all done' should go after Thread 1 finished <-| 
    22:40:12: Thread 1 finished                                                                      <-|


    Using the x.join() method we establish main thread to wait for the thread x to be 
    finished and only after - continue (print 'all done')
