Adapter - is used to make two incompatible interfaces compatible
Decorator - allows us to add responsibilities to an object in a dynamic way.
Bridge - designed up-front to decouple an implementation from its abstraction.
Flyweight - is used to reuse objects instead of recreating them. (On huge amounts)
MVC - Model View Controller (decoupling structure into three parts)
Proxy - provides some addition and restriction on the first object.


Adapter     |= makes 2+ interfaces able to work together (old and new)
Decorator   |= extends functionality of a component at runtime
Proxy       |= like one decorator very similar. Mostly used to extend funcs and provide authentication processes.
Facade      |=
Bridge      |= decouple an implementation from its abstraction
