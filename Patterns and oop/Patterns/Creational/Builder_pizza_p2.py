bacon pizza (CreamyBaconBuilder). Each builder creates a Pizza instance and contains methods that follow the 
pizza-making procedure: prepare_dough(), add_sauce(), add_topping(), and bake(). To be precise, prepare_dough() is 
just a wrapper to the prepare_dough() method of the Pizza class.

Afterword and home task:

But... supporting only two pizza types is a shame. Feel like getting a Hawaiian pizza builder? Consider using 
inheritance after thinking about the advantages and disadvantages. Check the ingredients of a typical Hawaiian pizza 
and decide which class you need to extend: MargaritaBuilder or CreamyBaconBuilder?. Perhaps both
